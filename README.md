# PyTorch-BAG
It details introduction to PyTorch as per BAG session held during Quarantine March -2020


## Requisite 
Torch Library ; Python ; Basics of Machine Learning

## Torch
Torch is used for building DeepNets, a scientific computing framework with support for ML algorithms with efficient usage.
It has wide variety of implementation and wrapper class developed on it. 
Getting Started guide to download and try Torch : [Getting Started](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
start with the code on the : [GitHub repo](https://github.com/torch/torch7)

## PyTorch

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python.
History : It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group.
Main Application : Natural Language Processing
Supervised Learning has varities of uses.

PyTorch is known for having three levels of abstraction as given below:
 Tensor – Imperative n-dimensional array which runs on GPU.
 Variable – Node in computational graph. This stores data and gradient.
 Module – Neural network layer which will store state or learnable weights.

PyTorch tensors usually utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations.
These tensors which are created in PyTorch can be used to fit a two-layer network to random data.
The user can manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network.
