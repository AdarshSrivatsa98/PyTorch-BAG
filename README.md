# PyTorch-BAG
It details introduction to PyTorch as per BAG session held during Quarantine March -2020


## Requisite 
Torch Library ; Python ; Basics of Machine Learning

## Torch
Torch is used for building DeepNets, a scientific computing framework with support for ML algorithms with efficient usage.<br/>
It has wide variety of implementation and wrapper class developed on it. <br/>
Getting Started guide to download and try Torch : [Getting Started](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)<br/>
start with the code on the : [GitHub repo](https://github.com/torch/torch7)<br/>

## PyTorch

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python.<br/>
History : It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group.<br/>
Main Application : Natural Language Processing<br/>
Even in Supervised Learning has varities of uses with PyTorch.<br/>

PyTorch is known for having three levels of abstraction as given below:<br/>
 Tensor – Imperative n-dimensional array which runs on GPU.<br/>
 Variable – Node in computational graph. This stores data and gradient.<br/>
 Module – Neural network layer which will store state or learnable weights.<br/>

PyTorch tensors usually utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations.<br/>
These tensors which are created in PyTorch can be used to fit a two-layer network to random data.<br/>
The user can manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network.<br/>
